%Our goal is to design a system that corrects the input to a projector if it is tilted so that its output appears unskewed.
%We will be projecting the display of a PC, and will connect the computer's VGA output to the FPGA board, and the FPGA board's VGA output to the projector.
%We will mount an accelerometer on the projector and measure its signals to determine the projector's tilt angles on two axes.
%We will run algorithms on the FPGA that correct the VGA input based on the tilt angles and produce the results at the VGA output for the projector to display.
%Finally, we will design digital logic that produces a voice specifying the new tilt angles whenever they are changed.
%The project was motivated by the increasing prevalance of portable projectors that benefit from fast automated setup.
